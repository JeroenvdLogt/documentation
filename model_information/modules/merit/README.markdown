## Introduction

The main purpose of the module is to calculate full load hours for electricity
producing technologies (called producers from now on) based on the demand for
electricity and their relative marginal costs. These full load hours are used
in the ETM for the scenarion in the 'future' year, impacting, among others, CO2
emissions, costs, import&export, total energy use and renewable percentages of
electricity and energy. In addition, the module calculates financial metrics
for producers such as profit and profitability (defined below).  The term
'merit order' refers to the order in which dispatchable plants (which will be
defined below) are used to fill up the demand for electricity. This order is
based on the marginal costs (in units of 'euro per MWh of produced
electricity') of these plants, which are essentially the costs of producing an
extra unit of electricity.  The Merit Order module is available in the
professional version of the ETM in the Cost > Merit Order slide shown in Figure
1.
