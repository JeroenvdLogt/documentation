### Power to Power storage

### Power to Heat  Power to heat is activated if storage is fully charged or
the battery charging rate is not sufficient to avoid curtailment.

current characterization P2H, to be validated by Hans Overdiep: 
* There are 7,512,824 households in NL, with 2.2 persons / household. Daily demand for hot
water: 132 per household (at 60 째C). This equates to a daily demand for hot
water of about 9 GJ, 7 kWh (and 287 W on average) 
* The idea is to equip all suitable hot water heaters with power-to-heat conversion technology  
* Only small tank are retrofitted: 100 liter tanks  
* Only a limited electric capacity is allowed, in order not to stress the electricity grid too much and
cause extra costs: Max 500 W electric for 100 liter retrofitted tanks. Max
1000 W electric for central combined heaters. 
* excess electricity can only be used to prepare hot water. This heat sinc is suitable because it there is a
constant demand and electricity demand and hot water demand can be 'decoupled'by a few hours.


#### p2h in combined systems:  This is a combined heating system that produced
space heating and hot water. Excess electricity is only used to provide
addtional heating to the storage tank. For setup, [click here](http://f.cl.ly/items/0E3c3S3K3m0R1g2O2F2H/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-11%20at%2009.56.18.png)

* 200 liter water storage 1000 W electric resistance heating in hot water
* storage  always at 60 째C  27 % of all households have this device the
* heating rate at 1000 W input is 4.3 째C / h (therefore, constant heating is
* not useful, it would lead to overheating) the potential for using excess
* electricity follows a diurnal profile (higher demand in the morning, very
* low demand after midnight. The hourly demamnd adds up the daily demand for
* hot water)

#### p2h in tankless heaters  46 % of all households are equipped with
combined tankless heating systems or have a tankless hot water boiler
(geiser).  They have to be retrofitted with a preheating tank. If electricity
is available, the preheating tank is heated and the demand for gas heating is
reduced when the tap is opened. [For setup, clck here](http://f.cl.ly/items/1P0g2N393b3R1m2D0E34/Screen%20Shot%202013-02-11%20at%2009.56.28.png)

* retrofit tankless systems with a 100 liter preheating tank max heat input:
* 500 W max heating rate: 4.3 째C/h  the system can only be charged with 7 kWh
* (daily demand for hot water) within the 'last' 24 hours. Additional heating
* would lead to overheating.

#### Costs
Costs have to be refined. Installation costs for both systems are assued to be around 500 euro.
