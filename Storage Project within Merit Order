# Storage Project within the merit order module

## Scope

In a first attempt, storage will only fulfill the following functionality within the merit order: 

* storage is a participant that can consume or produce electricity (if charged). 
* storage is incorporated within the merit order module. It can be disabled by setting its charging capcity or maximum storage charge to zero. 
* Only excess electricity is stored. The trigger for charging storage is a negative residual demand (the availability of excess electricity that would be exported or curtailed otherwise). How storage and export compete for excess electricity is yet to be decided. 
* the trigger for discharging storage is a positive residual demand. As storage is discharged, the full load hours of dispatchables decreases. In consequence, storage does not act economically, as it does not maximise revenues during discharge. 

## Nomenclature

* storage makes use of the same classification of participants as merit order: 
    dispatchable producers (can be switched on and off at will)
    volatile produers (can be switched off but not on at will)
    must-run producers (produces electricity as a by-product and is insensitive to changes in electricity demand)

### Residual load curve
The merit order uses a demand curve as in input. This demand may be (partly) fulfilled by the load from volatiles and must-run participants. The residual load is the demand minus the load from volatiles and must-runs. 

### Excess electricity (or Surplus electricity)
Excess electricity occurs whenever the residual load is negative. Whenever excess electricity occurs, the domestic demand for electricity is already satisfied. Dispatchables are turned off. Excess electiricity is usually exported, but can also be stored in electricity storage, curtailed or converted into gas, heat... 

### Curtailment 
Curtailment occurs in situations of excess electricity. If excess electricity cannot be assigned to a consumer (e.g. export or storage), it has to be curtailed. On a physical level this means that producers of electricity are told to shut down by the grid operator. Curtailing electricity is a measure to maintain grid stability. Currently, curtailment hardly occurs; however, it is expected to increase significantly in the future. Curtailment by be caused or amplified by limited export capacities or transmission grid constraints. 

### Avoided Curtailment 
Avoided curtailment is the amount of electricity that would have been curtailed if no preventive measure had been taken. 

### Electricity Storage
Electricity is stored in the form of another energy carrier. For example, chemical energy in batteries or potential energy in pumped hydro plants. This storage reservoir is emptied on demand, and electricity is generated by discharging the storage. 
Electricity storage is characterized by numerous parameters, like charging/dischargin efficiency (roundtrip efficiency), self-discharge, maximum capacity, maximum energy content and costs.... 

### Storage Capacity
Storage capacity refers to the load that a storage device draws from the grid. Just like the capacity of a gas plant, the storage capacity is a power measured in Watts. In contrast to ordinary language, storage capacity does not refer to an energy content (thinking of AA batteries). 

### Maximum Storage Charge 
Storage can be fully charged. Opposite to other participants, storage is limited by its maximum charge. Storage might become unavailable for further charging when full. Similarly, storage can no longer discharge when empty. 

### Load shifting 
### Load shifting only if both are fulfilled:
It triggers an extra production when storage is filled
It displaces production when storage is discharged 
Electricity is actually taken out of the system and stored in the form of another energy carrier. 





### Demand shifting, demand side management 


### Ramping 
As the demand and the generation from volatiles and must-runs changes over time, the dispatchables have to adapt their output. Ramping refers to the gradient of the resdual load curve. Similarly, ramping may also refer to the change in dispatchable generation, which has to follow the change in residual demand. 
Ramping does not refer to switching a plant on 'gradually'.
