# Documentation

Central place to put documentation in. As a replacements for the infamous
[Wiki](http://wiki.quintel.nl).

## Proposed folder structure:

* Internal Information
  * Getting started at Quintel
  * Human Resources
  * Contact information
  * Expenses
* Model information
  * General calculation
    * Costs
    * CO2
    * Renewability
  * Technical workings
  * Modules
    * ETFlex
    * Merit
    * Industry

## Migrating from the old Wiki

We'll have to think of a way to translate the current MediaWiki stuff to
Markdown. Maybe there are translaters for this?

## Exposing information from this repository to somewhere else

We'll get there. There are plenty of possible solutions that come to mind.
