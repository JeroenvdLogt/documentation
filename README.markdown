# Documentation

Central place to put documentation in. As a replacements for the infamous
[Wiki](http://wiki.quintel.nl).

## Proposed folder structure:

* Internal Information
  * Getting started at Quintel
  * Human Resources
  * Contact information
  * Expenses
* Model information
  - General calculation
    o Costs
    o CO2
    o Renewability
  - Technical workings
  - Modules
    o ETFlex
    o Merit
    o Industry

## Migrating from the old Wiki

We'll have to think of a way to translate the current MediaWiki stuff to
Markdown. Maybe there are translaters for this? 

For manual markdown formatting jobs, this website may be helpful: [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io).
Alternatively, you might want to download the application [Mou](http://mouapp.com/). 
GitHub cheatsheet for markdown formatting: https://gist.github.com/1146055. 


## Exposing information from this repository to somewhere else

We'll get there. There are plenty of possible solutions that come to mind.
