# ETMoses documentation

[ETMoses](http://beta.moses.et-model.com) allows the user to scale down a national ETM scenario to the size of a typical pilot project. This scaled scenario can be imported in ETMoses and investigate the impact of the scaled down scenario on the load on the network. In addition, the user can implement strategies to spread or shift load and study the effect of different market models.

The meaningfulness of the results from ETMoses highly depends on the quality of the input data. Generally speaking the input data consists of load, use and availability profiles and technological specifications. Below you can find references to separate documents describing he sources and logic for these input data.

In addition, several how-to guides can be accessed from this document.
