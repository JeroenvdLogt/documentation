# ETMoses documentation

The [testing ground functionality](testing_ground.md) alows the user to scale down a national ETM scenario to the size of a typical pilot project. This scaled scenario can be imported in the testing ground environment of the ETM. In this section we describe new functionality that let's you

* specify the network topology on local testing ground level
* choose the capacities of network components
* attach producing and consuming technologies to the network
* calculate load/used capacity for the components of the network


This documentation is twofold: on the one hand it describes how to work woth ETMoses; on the other it summarizes the sources behind the data that is used in ETMoses.
